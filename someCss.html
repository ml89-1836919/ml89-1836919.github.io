        <p> This is Keith Price's number one Fan Site! He is a good leader, wins games, throws awesome passes, hits his targets, can run when he needs to, and has a cheesy smile. Huskies have been on point this season with a starting record of 4-0. The Huskies smashed Boise State, pummeled Illinois, dominated Idaho State, and ran all over Arizona. <br /><br /> <span id="bow">Bow Down to Washington!!</span></p>
